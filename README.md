## ‚ùì How to use
You need to install a special software (example: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), cURL) which allows
you to send different [requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) to the server.

_Or you can also create your own UI or application to display all the information from the response in a more beautiful way
(Website, Mobile Application, etc.)_

In the **next step** there are some [endpoints](#-endpoints), their request methods, and description.
To use them you need to write URL with some kind of endpoint in `request URL` field,
depending on the endpoint create a request with
`body/path-variable/request-parameter` and at the end - send the request. After this you will receive
a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object or no-body response with [code status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

Before using endpoints you need to authenticate yourself with `/login` endpoint

As a step for authentication, the application uses
**Basic Authentication** [(read more)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
which means that the credentials in `(email:password)` format encoded in Base64 and stored in the
Authorization header.

‚ùó Access to endpoints depends on the roles of the logged in user. There is two roles: `Admin` and `User`

Credentials for testing already deployed project:

|  Role   |       Email        | Password   |
|:-------:|:------------------:|:-----------|
| `Admin` | `admin@cinema.com` | `pass1234` |
| `User`  |  `alice@mail.com`  | `1234pass` |

## ‚öô How to setup?
1. Install PostgreSQL, Tomcat, Java, Maven, Git
2. Clone a newest version of the project
3. Configure a Tomcat and PostgreSQL
4. Change database properties in `src/main/resources/db.properties`
   to the actual properties for your database
5. Change credentials of initial users in `src/main/resources/credentials.properties`

   ‚ùó These properties are for creating default admin and user which are created when you start the application
6. Start a configured Tomcat

After these steps you can start using the REST application ‚ú®
