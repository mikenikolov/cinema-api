## ‚ùì How to use
You need to install a special software (example: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), cURL) which allows
you to send different [requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) to the server.

_Or you can also create your own UI or application to display all the information from the response in a more beautiful way
(Website, Mobile Application, etc.)_

**üîë Authentication**

As a step for authentication, the application uses
[Token Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/).
As a token, the application uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction).
You can get JWT token following `/login` endpoint with `POST` method and request body 
with **valid** credentials: `{"email", "password"}`. In response you will get [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) 
object: `{"owner", "issuedDate", "expirationDate", "token"}`.

`expirationDate` - the date after which the token is invalid and cannot be used again

`token` - **our token** which we need to store

The user must send this `token` in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected endpoints.

Example: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

*JWT validity time on [already deployed project](#-cinema-api-) = 30 mins*

**üîßÔ∏è Using endpoints**

In the **next step** there are some [endpoints](#-endpoints), their request methods, and description.
To use them you need to write URL with some kind of endpoint in `request URL` field,
depending on the endpoint create a request with
`body/path-variable/request-parameter`, set received token to the `Authorization` header 
and then - send the request. After this you will receive
a JSON object with data or no-body response with [status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).


‚ùó Access to endpoints depends on the roles of the logged in user. There is two roles: `Admin` and `User`

‚ùó `/register` endpoint creating users ONLY with `User` role

Credentials for testing already deployed project:

|  Role   |       Email        | Password   |
|:-------:|:------------------:|:-----------|
| `Admin` | `admin@cinema.com` | `pass1234` |
| `User`  |  `alice@mail.com`  | `1234pass` |

## ‚öô How to setup?
1. Install PostgreSQL, Tomcat, Java, Maven, Git
2. Clone a newest version of the project
3. Configure a Tomcat and PostgreSQL
4. Change database properties in `src/main/resources/db.properties`
   to the actual properties for your database
5. Change credentials of initial users in `src/main/resources/credentials.properties`

   ‚ùó These properties are for creating default admin and user which are created when you start the application
6. Change the value of `jwt.token.validityTime` (in milliseconds) in `src/main/resources/security.properties`

   ‚ùó This will be validity time of the JWT token

7. Start a configured Tomcat

After these steps you can start using the REST application ‚ú®
